    <p align="center">Subject activities seem intimidating since not everyone is fond of activities/ tasks, especially in certain topics, ideas, and fields of activities. In this area, the students developed  a sense of teamwork among teammates and shared commitment to finish all the activities/tasks the instructors given to them.  within those days, they discovered their own strengths and weaknesses and how they can be able to be productive working in a team despite all those self-doubt and hardships they have been encounter during those times. Some of those students develop a sense of leadership, some seek to strive for more, and some are just going with the flow. School activities mold us as what we are right now. Those for strive for the best, become the best. To those who are always willing to learn and brave enough to accept challenges, learn something new and become better. those who never try, they become a failure. For students, school activities are not just activities. It shows how persistent, disciplined, and adaptable they are since no one can finish one task without those characteristics. The student of WRI Colleges wants everyone to learn something from them. "The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team." Whether we are in a team work or in an individual activities, we must develop our strengths and acknowledge our weaknesses.</p>
