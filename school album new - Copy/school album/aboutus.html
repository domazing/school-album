    <p style="justified">Welcome to our Digital School Album, where memories come to life in the most engaging and accessible way possible. Our platform is dedicated to capturing the essence of school life, preserving the moments that matter, and fostering a sense of community among students, teachers, and parents.
      I , Alexis Estrillana and Together with my companion we're tasked with creating the content for our website, which is called the SCHOOL ALBUM of WRI 2022â€“2024. Our responsibility is to obtain information, designed and  forward it to our website's coder.
       our purpose of this project is for us to have access a digital school album in a modern, efficient way to celebrate, remember, and share school experiences.
      As a designer and as a Researcher both of us should agree first on each other, before proposing it to the group we talk and ask each other opinion about the design and after we agree we show it to the group and accept their critics.
      We, as a designer and researchers also in charge of the whole design of the webpage, compiling pictures at every school program in order to document them for our webpage and talk to the programmer on how and where the buttons should be, we also tell the programmer on how each page should present when it is activated. We also discuss to the programmer on how it will look like if we apply the design on the webpage.
      This can make the school album more engaging and dynamic. Plus, the use of digital tools can allow for easier updates and sharing with classmates long after graduation. Exploring the possibilities of augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR) within a school album could take it to an entirely new level, making it an immersive experience that captures the essence of school life in an unprecedented way</p>
